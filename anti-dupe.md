By numbering each card with a number and the total amount of cards in a fraction format(n/n), the recipient can confirm if they have received each card once and only once. If the received number of cards does not match with the total amount of cards stated on each card or duplication of cards (cards that share the same numerator) is found, then each card is not received once and only once.
