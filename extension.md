Send to any individual on the whole UW campus:
1. Each individual should have an unique identity that can be used to identify the sender and recipient.
2. The identity should contain information about an individual. For example,  the identity can contain three parts: Building, Room Number, the n-th individual in the room. Individuals in MGH can be 001, ODE can be 002... By putting these three parts together, we can find a random individual on campus as long as they are listed. 001.314.12 represents the 12th person in MGH at room 314.

Specify whether contents are ASCII text, Unicode text, or binary values:
1. Each format of text should be written on different papers and ideally the whole text should only contain one format. ASCII uses pink paper, Unicode uses blue and binary uses Yellow.

Keep a record of what nodes the card has passed through:
1. On the back of the card, when a node receives the card, they should write their ID on the back of the paper and time.
2. I am not sure if the node itself should record the receive and send of cards for security reasons.
